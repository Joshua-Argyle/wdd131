			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>To create a site where a large selection of movies can be rated and reviewed to give movie watchers a place to check to see if a movie is worth watching.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>People who watch movies</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>The site would have a form, in which certain aspects of a movie would be rated such as how much action, romance, or comedic elements a movie has from a rating 1 to 10. It would also have the option to search for a specific movie to see the ratings people gave it from the forms people filled out.</p>

			<h2>Branding</h2>
			<h3>Website Logo</h3>
			<!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
			Palette URL:
			<a

			<h3>Typography</h3>
			<!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p><img src="hero.webp" alt="Movie Theatre">
                Will include nav, logo, as well as buttons to other pages, and footer.
                Rate your favorite movies, and view the ratings of others. Don't waste time watching a bad movie with Film Inspect!

                Want more than a single percentage or star rating? View ratings for action, comedy, romance levels, and more. The movie you watch tonight shoudn't be based on one rating. Watch the movie that matches your mood.
                
            </p>
			<h3>Rate a Movie</h3>
			<p>Will contain form</p>
            <h3>Movie Ratings</h3>
			<p>Will contain several movies and their ratings provided from the form data. Below are just a few of the 12 or so movies I plan to include into my site.
                <img src="movie_posters/harry potter.jpg" alt="Harry Potter">
                <img src="movie_posters/tenet.jpg" alt="Tenet">

            </p>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
				here
			</p>

            <h3>Home</h3>

				NA
			</p>
			<img src="Home.png" alt="Home Wire Frame" />
			<h3>Movie Ratings</h3>

				The movies available will be apart of a large list of movies preselected. The user won't be able to add a movie.
			</p>
			<img src="Movie Ratings.png" alt="Movie Ratings Wire Frame" />
            

			<h3>Rate a Movie</h3>
